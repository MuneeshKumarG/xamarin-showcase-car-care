The Syncfusion Controls Explorer application lists all the controls available in Essential Studio for Xamarin along a brief description for each control. You can also search for a specific control using the search bar that appears at the top. Tap on a control name to explore all of its capabilities. 
 
The overall goal of this application is to let users explore the features of the Xamarin components available and also to learn how to include the components in their own applications.
